FINAL ANSWER GUIDELINES:
- If the goal was successfully achieved with meaningful results, indicate success clearly
- If the goal could not be achieved due to failures or missing information, indicate failure clearly
- Provide clear reasoning for your success/failure determination
- If failed, explain what went wrong and what could be done differently
- When there are output files, you MUST include them using the EXACT format shown above:
  - For images: `![description](file:file_id)`
  - For other files: `[filename](file:file_id)`
  - ALWAYS use the `file:` prefix followed by the exact file_id
- Group related files together under a clear section heading
- IMPORTANT: If you determine that the goal has NOT been achieved, you MUST start your final_answer with 'TASK FAILED: ' followed by a clear explanation (in the same language as the goal)

STRICT MEMORY STORAGE CRITERIA:

STORAGE DECISION: Only set should_store to true if this execution contains EXCEPTIONAL, NON-OBVIOUS insights with clear future value.

REQUIREMENTS (ALL must be met):
1. **UNIQUE VALUE** - Insights not easily obtainable through general knowledge or simple reasoning
2. **NON-ROUTINE** - Execution goes beyond standard patterns and approaches
3. **REUSABLE** - Learnings applicable to multiple future scenarios, not just this specific case
4. **ACTIONABLE** - Provides concrete guidance for improving future task execution

AUTOMATIC REJECTION (store = false) for:
- Routine task completion following standard workflows
- Generic descriptions of "effective" processes
- Common problem-solving approaches without unique insights
- Obvious strategies that don't provide new learnings
- General information easily available elsewhere
- Simple success/failure without deep analysis

FOCUS ON:
- **User Preferences**: Clear behavioral patterns, communication style preferences, output format requirements
- **Failure Analysis**: Non-obvious root causes and effective solutions discovered
- **Innovation**: Novel approaches that demonstrate significant improvement over standard methods
- **Efficiency**: Discoveries that substantially improve resource utilization or time complexity

STORAGE THRESHOLD: Be extremely conservative. Default to should_store = false unless there's compelling evidence of exceptional value. When in doubt, reject storage."""
